## How It Works

Every AI model sees something different. Google Vision might catch the landmark but miss the mood. Claude nails the description but doesn't extract text. Clarifai tags objects that others overlook.

Visionati runs your image through multiple services and returns everything in one response. You pick the [backends](/reference/backends/) and [features](/reference/features/) you want, and only pay for what you use.
